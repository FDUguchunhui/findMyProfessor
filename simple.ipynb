I designed and directed the French Biosafety 4 Level principally for studies of Ebola and Lassa fever for which I received the Légion d’Honneur.  I joined the Brownsville campus of the School of Public Health to work in health disparity population health in 2001.  In 2004 I helped found the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (n=5000) which I direct.  This is a randomly selected community based cohort of health disparity Mexican Americans.  Using these data I have collaborative programs in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancers understudied minorities with a wide range of collaborators from major institutions across the country, funded by several NIH and CPRIT grants, and having produced more than 60 publications.

I joined the CDC EIS and worked in Brazil as a PAHO/CDC consultant for the meningitis outbreaks of 1974-6.  In 1977 I founded the CDC Lassa fever project in Sierra Leone. I investigated the first Ebola epidemic in 1976 and led the one in 1979.   In Sierra Leone I conducted definitive studies of the epidemiology and antiviral treatment of Lassa fever.  As Chief, Special Pathogens Branch, Viral Diseases, CDC in 1982, I ran the Biosafety level 4 lab for 9 years.  I organized and led the first AIDS investigation in Africa in 1983 and established the Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Congo.

I joined the CDC EIS and worked in Brazil as a PAHO/CDC consultant for the meningitis outbreaks of 1974-6.  In 1977 I founded the CDC Lassa fever project in Sierra Leone. I investigated the first Ebola epidemic in 1976 and led the one in 1979.   In Sierra Leone I conducted definitive studies of the epidemiology and antiviral treatment of Lassa fever.  As Chief, Special Pathogens Branch, Viral Diseases, CDC in 1982, I ran the Biosafety level 4 lab for 9 years.  I organized and led the first AIDS investigation in Africa in 1983 and established the Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Congo.  In 1983 I isolated the virus that causes Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (Hantavirus) at CDC.  \n",

If you are interested in microbial biology and infectious diseases, Dr. Jennifer Walker would be a good choice. If you are interested in genetics and computational biology, Professor Yunxin Fu could be a good match. For a focus on infectious diseases and genomics, Assistant Professor Blake Hanson would be a suitable option. You could also consider Professor Chloe Sarnowski if you have an interest in genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics. These are just a few suggestions based on the professors' specialties in biology-related fields.\n",
