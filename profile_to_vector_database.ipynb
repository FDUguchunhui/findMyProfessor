Our group focuses on developing innovative environmental and genomic surveillance systems to understand population health and monitor the spread of infectious diseases. Using molecular virology, genomic sequencing, and mathematical modeling, our research works advance wastewater-based surveillance to track zoonotic pathogens, analyze the evolution of genomic variants, and forecast infection transmission dynamics. By integrating these tools, we aim to create early-warning systems for viral outbreaks and uncover key insights into pathogenic agents’ transmission and public health.\\nCurrent projects in my lab include:\\nWastewater-based Epidemiology: Developing methodologies for detecting pathogenic agents in community wastewater, capturing infection trends over time and space, and integrating surveillance data with mathematical models to predict outbreak dynamics and track viral evolution.\\nViral Metagenomics and Discovery: Employing cutting-edge metagenomic sequencing to explore human viral diversity, with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive global map of human viruses.\\nMicrobiome and Medicine: Investigating the interactions between viral infections, antiviral treatments, and the gut microbiome.

Specifically, I work with models for linkage disequilibrium (LD), and develop applications for taking proper account of the dependence among nearby loci. These applications include haplotype inference, missing genotype imputation, disease mapping, genotype error detection and correction, the visualization of haplotype variation, and the integration of emerging data types such as next generation DNA sequencing. For these applications I maintain a widely-used software package called fastPHASE.\\nA rotation in my lab could provide a student with exposure to several state-of-the-art haplotype-based software packages (such as PHASE, fastPHASE, Beagle, and Mach) and, in the process, could help evaluate different models for LD for various applications and settings. These models rely on hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques and implicitly a student would gain some introduction to these as well as algorithms, such as Baum-Welch, Markov chain Monte Carlo and Expectation-Maximization. In addition, the student could perform hands-on data analyses and would gain experience in working with Perl and the statistical software R. A student with strong C programming skills could develop, test, and add a function for analysis to an existing software package.\\nThe Department of Epidemiology has space for students and postdocs and provides a rich academic atmosphere with a large number of faculty in the section of Computational Genetic Epidemiology. Ample computational support exists, including processors which support programs for genetic analysis, as well as standard programming and database management languages.\\nPubMed\\nMDACC Faculty\\nEducation & Training\\nPh.D. - University of Washington - 2006\\nPrograms\\nGenetics and Epigenetics\\nQuantitative Sciences\\nFaculty Development\\nMentoring Works\\nBack',\n",

I obtained my MD at Duke in 1971 and an MS from Harvard (1970) under Dr. Weller (Nobel Laureate 1954).  I trained at CHOP under Dr. Koop (later US Surgeon General).  I joined the CDC EIS and worked in Brazil as a PAHO/CDC consultant for the meningitis outbreaks of 1974-6.  In 1977 I founded the CDC Lassa fever project in Sierra Leone. I investigated the first Ebola epidemic in 1976 and led the one in 1979.   In Sierra Leone I conducted definitive studies of the epidemiology and antiviral treatment of Lassa fever.  As Chief, Special Pathogens Branch, Viral Diseases, CDC in 1982, I ran the Biosafety level 4 lab for 9 years.  I organized and led the first AIDS investigation in Africa in 1983 and established the Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Congo.  In 1983 I isolated the virus that causes Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (Hantavirus) at CDC.\\nIn 1993, I became Chairman, CHS at the Aga Khan University Medical School where I established a CDC EIS like program, an MS in Epidemiology, and a family Medicine Residency.  I founded the UT Houston School of Public Health campus in Brownsville in 2001. The campus has published over300 peer reviewed articles characterizing the extraordinary level of health disparities in the region. I was instrumental in bringing in over $100 million in external funding.\\nI now research chronic and infectious diseases in the LRGV in a cohort of 5000 people with over 30 research collaborators. I am featured in several books for the lay reader (e.g.,The Coming Plague, The Hot Zone). My wife, Sue Fisher-Hoch and I wrote a popular account (Level 4, Virus Hunters of the CDC) of our professional adventures translated into 7 languages. I am an amateur pianist, and enjoy many outdoor activities.\\nCenter Affiliation\\nHispanic Health Research Center\\nResearch Interests\\nBehavioral/Mental Health\\nBorder Health\\nCancer\\nCardiovascular and Chronic Diseases\\nClinical Trials\\nEpidemiology\\nGlobal Health\\nInfectious Disease\\nPersonal Links\\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/browse/collection/40492151/?sort=date&direction=ascending\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._McCormick\\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xgV24roAAAAJ\\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/interviews/mccormick.html',\n",
